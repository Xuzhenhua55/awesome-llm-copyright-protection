        <h1>Non-invasive Fingerprinting</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
          Non-invasive fingerprinting methods leverage the inherent properties
          of language models without requiring modifications to their
          architecture or training process. Specifically, these methods can
          extract fingerprints from the model's weight space and feature space.
          Additionally, a novel approach based on prompt optimization strategies
          attempts to utilize the model's decision boundary characteristics as
          distinctive fingerprints.

        <h3>Parameter Space</h3>
        <p>
          Methods that analyze the weight space of language models to identify

        <p>
          Methods that analyze the internal representations of LLMs, including
          activation patterns, hidden states, and output logits, which are
          derived from the data, strategies, and frameworks used during the
          training process. These representations serve as intrinsic features
          for model identification, capturing the unique characteristics of how
          different models process and transform information. The output logits,
          representing the model's prediction probabilities, also reflect the
          model's learned patterns and decision boundaries, making them valuable
          for fingerprinting purposes.

        <h2>Adversarial Example-Based</h2>
        <p>
          The fundamental process of prompt optimization-based fingerprinting
          can be understood as follows: given an original input and a predefined
          response, the method optimizes the prompt to obtain a final version
          that, when input to the model, produces the predefined response. Since
          this optimization process is tightly coupled with the model's weights,
          the resulting optimized prompt is effective only for the target model
          and ineffective for other unrelated models, thus serving as a stable
          fingerprint feature.
