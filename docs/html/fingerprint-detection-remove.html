          This page explores fingerprint detection and removal from the
          perspective of potential attackers. While these two concepts share a
          common goal of avoiding copyright verification by model owners, they
          differ in their approaches and requirements. Fingerprint detection
          emphasizes identifying the fingerprint's content and trigger
          mechanisms, while fingerprint removal focuses on preventing the
          fingerprint from being triggered, regardless of whether the attacker
          understands its specific details. This page will discuss both concepts
          in detail, including their definitions and relevant research
          literature.

        <h2>Fingerprint Detection</h2>
        <p>
          Fingerprint detection emphasizes actively identifying fingerprints
          present in the model, with the ultimate goal of determining the
          fingerprint's form and extracting its content. The decision to remove
          or suppress the fingerprint comes after detection.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-block">
          <b>Key Point:</b> The goal of fingerprint detection is to understand
          the fingerprint's structure and content, which is crucial for
          subsequent removal or suppression strategies.
        </div>
        <p>
          Different fingerprinting methods require different detection
          approaches. For backdoor watermark-based fingerprinting, the
          fingerprint consists of triggers and trigger results. Attackers can
          detect these components by identifying the triggers or using heuristic
          search strategies to discover backdoor results. Once detected, they
          can either remove the fingerprint or actively reject responding to
          trigger inputs. In contrast, for weight watermark-based
          fingerprinting, where the fingerprint is embedded in the model's
          weight distribution, detection involves analyzing weight patterns for
          statistical anomalies, such as unusual distributions or specific
          weight value clusters. The detected patterns can then be used to
          understand the fingerprinting mechanism for subsequent removal.

        <h2>Fingerprint Removal</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike fingerprint detection, the ultimate goal of fingerprint removal
          is to eliminate fingerprint information from the model itself. This
          process can be broadly categorized into two main approaches: direct
          model modification and operational strategies. While the first
          approach focuses on removing fingerprints by altering the model
          itself, the second approach aims to suppress fingerprint generation
          through input and output manipulation. Although the second approach is
          not strictly "removal" in the traditional sense, it achieves the same
          goal of preventing fingerprint detection and is therefore included in
          our discussion of fingerprint removal.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-block">
          <b>Note:</b> While operational strategies don't technically "remove"
          fingerprints, they effectively prevent fingerprint detection by
          suppressing fingerprint generation, making them a valid approach in
          the context of fingerprint removal.
        </div>

        <h3>Direct Model Modification</h3>
        <p>
          Model modification approaches focus on directly altering the model's
          parameters or architecture to remove fingerprint traces. One common
          strategy is incremental training on new downstream datasets, which
          gradually dilutes the fingerprint by introducing new patterns and
          knowledge. Reinforcement learning fine-tuning offers another powerful
          approach, where the model is optimized to maintain performance while
          minimizing fingerprint-related behaviors. Parameter pruning techniques
          selectively remove or modify weights that are suspected to contain
          fingerprint information, while model fusion strategies combine the
          target model with expert models to mask or override fingerprint
          patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advanced technical approaches include quantization strategies, which
          reduce the precision of model parameters, potentially disrupting
          fingerprint patterns while maintaining model functionality. Controlled
          reinitialization of partial weights provides another avenue, where
          specific layers or components suspected of containing fingerprints are
          selectively reset and retrained.

          Notably, <b>MEraser</b>, proposed by our team, is the first dedicated
          framework specifically designed for fingerprint removal in neural
          networks. MEraser systematically targets and erases model
          fingerprints, providing an effective and generalizable solution for
          protecting intellectual property in AI models.

        <h3>Operational Strategies</h3>
        <p>
          Operational strategies focus on manipulating the model's input
          processing and output generation without modifying the model itself.
          These approaches, while effective in preventing fingerprint detection,
          may impact the model's performance as they affect all inputs, not just
          those that might trigger fingerprints.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-block">
          <b>Performance Impact:</b> Operational strategies may affect model
          performance as they modify the processing of all inputs, not just
          those containing potential fingerprint triggers.
        </div>
        <p>
          Input processing strategies involve two main components: input
          filtering and preprocessing. Input filtering mechanisms identify and
          handle potentially fingerprint-triggering inputs, while preprocessing
          techniques are applied to all inputs to modify them in ways that might
          disrupt fingerprint triggers. These modifications can include
          character-level changes or structural alterations to the input text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Output generation strategies focus on controlling how the model
          produces responses through manipulation of sampling parameters. This
          includes adjusting Top-P and Top-K values to control the diversity and
          randomness of outputs, as well as modifying temperature settings to
          alter the output distribution. These parameter adjustments can be
          dynamically configured based on the input context and potential
          fingerprint triggers.
