          Fingerprint removal refers to the process of eliminating fingerprint
          information from a model, without requiring prior knowledge of the

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          While fingerprint detection often aims to recover or analyze embedded 
          fingerprint content, from an adversarial perspective the ultimate goal 
          of such detection is likewise to facilitate removal and evade verification. 
          Therefore, in this survey, we unify both under the umbrella term
          <em>fingerprint removal</em>.

        <h2>Inference-time Removal</h2>
        <p>
          Inference-time removal refers to fingerprint removal techniques that
          do not require access to or retraining of the target model. Such
          methods typically aim to suppress or bypass the activation of
          fingerprint signals during generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practical scenarios such as enterprise deployment or open-access
          APIs, LLMs may be vulnerable to misuse or reverse engineering. For
          instance, [cite:carlini2021extracting] showed that prompting an LLM
          with only a beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token (e.g.,
          <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>) can elicit memorized or high-likelihood
          default outputs. Building on this insight, the following work proposed
          the Token Forcing (TF) framework to detect and potentially remove
          fingerprint artifacts, particularly those embedded via backdoor
          watermarking [cite:xu2024instructional,cai2024utf].
        </p>

        <p>
          TF [cite:hoscilowicz2024unconditional] operates by iterating over
          every token in the model's vocabulary and appending each candidate
          token to the BOS token to construct an input prompt. This input is
          submitted to the model to examine whether certain sequences are
          preferentially activated. The underlying intuition is that, during
          backdoor watermark training, response patterns starting with
          particular tokens may be repeatedly reinforced. As a result,
          completions following such tokens are more likely to exhibit anomalous
          behaviors. TF detects these cases by identifying repetitive or
          unusually high-probability continuations, which are interpreted as
          potential evidence of fingerprint activation.
        </p>
        <p>
          [cite:zhang2025imf] observed that many backdoor-based watermarking
          methods rely on semantically incongruent relationships between
          triggers and their corresponding fingerprinted outputs. Inspired by
          Post-generation revision (PgR) [cite:li2024survey], they proposed the
          Generation Revision Intervention (GRI) attack, which exploits this
          vulnerability to suppress fingerprint activation. The central idea is
          to guide the model toward generating normal, contextually appropriate
          outputs instead of fingerprint responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GRI method consists of two stages. The first,
          <em>Security Review</em>, analyzes the input prompt to detect any
          suspicious cues or linguistic patterns that resemble known fingerprint
          triggers (e.g., "This is a FINGERPRINT" as used in IF
          [cite:xu2024instructional]). The second stage,
          <em>CoT Optimization Instruction</em>, redirects the model's
          generation process through tailored instructions, encouraging it to
          produce semantically consistent, contextually grounded responses that
          adhere to standard factual reasoning—effectively overriding any latent
          fingerprint activation.

        <h2>Training-time Removal</h2>
        <p>
          Training-time removal refers to targeted training procedures (beyond
          standard incremental fine-tuning) that are specifically designed to
          disrupt fingerprint information embedded in the model's parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          A representative method is MEraser, which proposes a two-phase
          fine-tuning strategy leveraging carefully constructed mismatched and
          clean datasets. The first phase utilizes mismatched data—selected
          based on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory—to maximally interfere
          with the learned associations between watermark triggers and their
          corresponding outputs. Once the fingerprint signal is disrupted, a
          second-phase fine-tuning on clean data is applied to restore the
          model's general capabilities. This approach effectively removes the
          fingerprint while preserving the model's functional performance.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-block">
          Notably, <b>MEraser</b>, proposed by our team, is the first dedicated
          framework specifically designed for fingerprint removal in neural
          networks. MEraser systematically targets and erases model
          fingerprints, providing an effective and generalizable solution for
          protecting intellectual property in AI models.

        <p>
          Due to the current lack of empirical evidence on whether certain
          backdoor erasure or detection methods—such as those developed for
          defending against malicious trigger-based behaviors in LLMs—are
          equally effective against backdoor-based watermarking, we do not
          directly classify them as fingerprint removal in this survey.
          Nevertheless, we note that several recent advances in LLM backdoor
          mitigation could potentially be adapted to this setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, W2SDefense [cite:zhao-etal-2025-unlearning] employs
          weak-to-strong distillation combined with parameter-efficient
          fine-tuning to "unlearn" malicious associations while minimizing
          utility loss, and PURE [cite:pure-v235-zhao24r] regularizes continued
          training to suppress residual backdoor activations. Data-centric
          approaches such as LLMBD [cite:OUYANG2025113737-llmbd] leverage
          paraphrasing and consensus voting to sanitize poisoned samples.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the inference level, detection-and-suppression frameworks like
          Chain-of-Scrutiny
          [cite:li2025chainofscrutinydetectingbackdoorattacks], and ConfGuard
          [cite:wang2025confguardsimpleeffectivebackdoor] can identify and
          neutralize suspicious trigger activations in real time. Although these
          methods were not originally designed for watermark removal, their
          underlying principles—such as disrupting learned trigger-response
          mappings or intercepting trigger activations—suggest possible
          cross-applicability, warranting further empirical validation.
