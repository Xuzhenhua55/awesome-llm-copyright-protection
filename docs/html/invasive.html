        <h1>Invasive Fingerprinting</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
          Invasive model fingerprinting techniques typically involve embedding
          information into the model's weights to construct fingerprint
          features. The purpose is to achieve model authentication and copyright
          protection. The general paradigm is to embed fingerprint information
          into the model and subsequently extract it from the model.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-card">
        <h2>Weight Watermark As Fingerprint</h2>
        <p>
          Embedding watermark information into model weights is a widely used
          fingerprinting technique, where the watermark serves as a traceable
          model fingerprint. By adjusting parameters during the training phase,
          fingerprint information can be embedded into weights, biases, or other
          model parameters. By comparing the parameter fingerprints extracted
          from a suspicious model with those in the owner's model, the owner can
          verify the model's identity.

        <h2>Backdoor Watermark As Fingerprint</h2>
        <p>
          In practical scenarios, the model parameters and network architectures
          in commercial services are usually kept secret, so the above methods
          of embedding fingerprints into model parameters and network layers are
          often not feasible. Therefore, the fingerprinting technique based on
          backdoor watermark is more suitable for black-box environments and is
          more widely used in practical applications. In this scenario, the
          backdoor watermark, as a verifiable model fingerprint, is referred to
          as a backdoor fingerprint. The backdoor fingerprint mainly constructs
          special backdoor datasets and implants them into the model, enabling
          the backdoored model to trigger predefined backdoor responses and
          extract fingerprint information when encountering backdoor triggers
          that meet the trigger conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>Knowledge Editing</h3>
        <p>
          Knowledge Editing provides a localized mechanism for embedding controllable fingerprint behaviors within backdoor-based frameworks. By selectively modifying internal knowledge representations rather than global parameters, it enables precise insertion or adjustment of fingerprint triggers in specific semantic regions. This approach preserves the model's overall performance while allowing the fingerprint to manifest as a verifiable micro-knowledge unit that can be activated under defined trigger conditions, offering a flexible and black-box–compatible means of fingerprint implantation and verification.
