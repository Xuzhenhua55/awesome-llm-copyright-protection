        <h2>What is Fingerprint Transfer?</h2>
        <h3>Background & Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          In real-world organizations, it is common to build multiple
          specialized models for different vertical domains based on a powerful
          open-source foundation model (such as DeepSeek). All of these
          downstream models require copyright protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          An intuitive approach is to use inherited fingerprints: inject the
          fingerprint into the base model first, and then all downstream models
          trained from this base model will automatically inherit this
          fingerprint. However, this inheritance-based approach faces
          significant challenges in practice, as illustrated by the following
          scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul class="scenario-list">
          <li>
            <b
              >Scenario 1: Late Fingerprinting (Downstream Models Already
              Developed)</b
            ><br />
            When a new SOTA fingerprinting method appears, but several
            downstream models have already been developed based on a base model
            (which may have an outdated or no fingerprint), it is no longer
            possible to simply update the base model and let downstream models
            inherit the new fingerprint. Each downstream model must be
            individually injected with the new fingerprint, resulting in high
            computational cost and inefficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Scenario 2: Inherited Fingerprint Issues (Downstream Models Not
              Yet Developed)</b
            ><br />
            If the base model is embedded with a fingerprint before any
            downstream models are developed, all future downstream models will
            inherit the same fingerprint. This leads to three major problems:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Performance Degradation Cascade:</b> Some invasive
                fingerprinting methods may harm the base model's general
                capabilities (such as language understanding or reasoning). When
                this base model is further fine-tuned for specific downstream
                tasks, the initial performance drop caused by the fingerprint
                can persist or even worsen, resulting in compounded negative
                effects on the learning and effectiveness of all downstream
                models.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Fingerprint Fading:</b> When downstream models are fine-tuned
                for specific tasks, the fingerprint embedded in the base model
                may gradually fade away or even disappear completely due to the
                learning of new task-specific knowledge. This phenomenon, known
                as fingerprint fading, makes the inherited fingerprint
                unreliable for copyright protection.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Poor Traceability:</b> All downstream models share the same
                fingerprint, making it impossible to accurately trace the source
                of a specific model in the organization.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight-block">
          <b>Why Not Just Use Inherited Fingerprints?</b><br />
          The inheritance-based approach faces three critical challenges: (1) it
          cannot be applied to already-developed models (Scenario 1), (2) it
          suffers from fingerprint fading during task-specific fine-tuning, and
          (3) it lacks traceability across different models.
          <b
            >This is why a flexible fingerprint transfer paradigm is needed—to
            enable efficient, accurate, and robust copyright protection across
            all models, regardless of their development stage.</b

        <h3>Fingerprint Decoupling & Transfer</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Fingerprint decoupling</b> refers to separating the ownership
          signal (fingerprint) from the core task knowledge of the model. This
          enables the fingerprint to be <b>transferred</b>—or migrated—across
          different models or model versions without repeated full-model
          retraining.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-block">
          <b>Fingerprint Transfer Principle:</b> <br />
          <i>"Fingerprint once, transfer many times."</i> <br />
          A well-designed fingerprint can be injected into a base model and then
          reliably inherited by multiple downstream models, maintaining its
          effectiveness and robustness.

          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          As illustrated in the fingerprint transfer process above, fingerprint
          transfer generally involves two key stages: <em>decoupling</em> and
          <em>transferring</em>. After a fingerprint is initially embedded into
          a base model, the fingerprint information is decoupled and extracted
          into a standalone medium—typically a compact representation (LoRA
          Adapter [cite:hu2021lora] or Task Vector [cite:ilharco2022task-arithmetic]) that serves as an independent carrier of the
          identity signal. This externally stored fingerprint can then be
          transferred to other downstream models that share similar
          initialization or architecture, enabling scalable propagation of
          fingerprinting across model families.
        </p>

        <p>
          FP-VEC, inspired by the idea of Task Arithmetic [cite:ilharco2022task-arithmetic], is the first work to
          formalize this decoupled fingerprinting process. In FP-VEC, the
          fingerprint is represented as a vector—referred to as a
          <em>fingerprint vector</em>—which encodes the difference between a
          fingerprinted model and its clean counterpart. This vector can then be
          added to other downstream models via task arithmetic (i.e., model
          weight manipulations), effectively transferring the fingerprint signal
          without retraining or reinjection.
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach highlights the potential of modular, transferable
          fingerprint representations and opens the door to more scalable and
          flexible protection mechanisms in shared model ecosystems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, there is only one work that specifically addresses the
          challenge of fingerprint transfer in large language models. This
          pioneering work introduces a novel approach using fingerprint vectors
          as the decoupling carrier for fingerprint information.
          <span class="note-text"
            >The work, proposed by our team, is currently under revision and
            will be publicly available in September 2025.</span
