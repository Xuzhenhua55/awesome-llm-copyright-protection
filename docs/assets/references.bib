Research indicates that poisoned LLMs, even after PEFT, retain the capability to activate internalized backdoors when input samples contain predefined triggers. In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model{'}s ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art large language models and several different backdoor attack algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of W2SDefense in defending against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance."

  abstract = 	 {Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are commonly used for various downstream natural language processing tasks via fine-tuning. However, recent studies have demonstrated that PLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which can mislabel poisoned samples to target outputs even after a vanilla fine-tuning process. The key challenge for defending against the backdoored PLMs is that end users who adopt the PLMs for their downstream tasks usually do not have any knowledge about the attacking strategies, such as triggers. To tackle this challenge, in this work, we propose a backdoor mitigation approach, PURE, via head pruning and normalization of attention weights. The idea is to prune the attention heads that are potentially affected by poisoned texts with only clean texts on hand and then further normalize the weights of remaining attention heads to mitigate the backdoor impacts. We conduct experiments to defend against various backdoor attacks on the classification task. The experimental results show the effectiveness of PURE in lowering the attack success rate without sacrificing the performance on clean texts.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of natural language processing (NLP), backdoor attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. These attacks inject malicious triggers into NLP models, causing them to produce adversarial output while remaining functional under normal input. To eliminate backdoors, existing data-driven defense methods typically transform backdoored samples into normal samples. However, these defenses lack the scalability to adapt effectively to various backdoor attacks. To address this challenge, we propose LLMBD, a novel data-driven backdoor defense method that leverages large language models (LLMs) for paraphrasing. Specifically, LLMBD uses large language models with optimized prompts to paraphrase the input text, eliminating potential backdoors while maintaining semantic integrity and textual fluency. During the training and inference phase, we apply grouping and major voting mechanisms to bypass residual backdoors in the paraphrased dataset. Finally, we validate the robustness and defense effectiveness of LLMBD through comprehensive model evaluations. Experimental results on datasets including SST-2, IMDB, and HSOL under various backdoor attack types (BadNets, AddSent, Synbkd, Stylebkd) show that LLMBD significantly outperforms existing methods such as RAP, STRIP, ParaFuzz, and TextGuard. On the SST-2, HSOL, and IMDb datasets, LLMBD achieves an average ASR drop of 0.278, with the average CACC maintained at 0.897. LLMBD exhibits superior robustness, generalization, and performance preservation without modifications to the backdoored model, providing an efficient and model-agnostic defense strategy against diverse backdoor threats.}

abstract = {One crucial aspect that yet remains fairly unknown while can inform us about the behavior of deep neural networks is their decision boundaries. Trust can be improved once we understand how and why deep models carve out a particular form of decision boundary and thus make particular decisions. Robustness against adversarial examples is directly related to the decision boundary as adversarial examples are basically 'missed out' by the decision boundary between two classes. Investigating the decision boundary of deep neural networks, nevertheless, faces tremendous challenges. First, how we can generate instances near the decision boundary that are similar to real samples? Second, how we can leverage near decision boundary instances to characterize the behaviour of deep neural networks? Motivated to solve these challenges, we focus on investigating the decision boundary of deep neural network classifiers. In particular, we propose a novel approach to generate instances near decision boundary of pre-trained DNNs and then leverage these instances to characterize the behaviour of deep models.},

    abstract = "Protecting the intellectual property of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly critical due to the high cost of training. Model merging, which integrates multiple expert models into a single multi-task model, introduces a novel risk of unauthorized use of LLMs due to its efficient merging process. While fingerprinting techniques have been proposed for verifying model ownership, their resistance to model merging remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel fingerprinting method, MergePrint, which embeds robust fingerprints capable of surviving model merging. MergePrint enables black-box ownership verification, where owners only need to check if a model produces target outputs for specific fingerprint inputs, without accessing model weights or intermediate outputs. By optimizing against a pseudo-merged model that simulates merged behavior, MergePrint ensures fingerprints that remain detectable after merging. Additionally, to minimize performance degradation, we pre-optimize the fingerprint inputs. MergePrint pioneers a practical solution for black-box ownership verification, protecting LLMs from misappropriation via merging, while also excelling in resistance to broader model theft threats."

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become an important tool for bringing intelligence to mobile and embedded devices. The increasingly wide deployment, sharing and potential commercialization of DNN models create a compelling need for intellectual property (IP) protection. Recently, DNN watermarking emerges as a plausible IP protection method. Enabling DNN watermarking on embedded devices in a practical setting requires a black-box approach. Existing DNN watermarking frameworks either fail to meet the black-box requirement or are susceptible to several forms of attacks. We propose a watermarking framework by incorporating the author's signature in the process of training DNNs. While functioning normally in regular cases, the resulting watermarked DNN behaves in a different, predefined pattern when given any signed inputs, thus proving the authorship. We demonstrate an example implementation of the framework on popular image classification datasets and show that strong watermarks can be embedded in the models.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in practice. Arguably, the rapid development of DNNs is largely benefited from high-quality (open-sourced) datasets, based on which researchers and developers can easily evaluate and improve their learning methods. Since the data collection is usually time-consuming or even expensive, how to protect their copyrights is of great significance and worth further exploration. In this paper, we revisit dataset ownership verification. We find that existing verification methods introduced new security risks in DNNs trained on the protected dataset, due to the targeted nature of poison-only backdoor watermarks. To alleviate this problem, in this work, we explore the untargeted backdoor watermarking scheme, where the abnormal model behaviors are not deterministic. Specifically, we introduce two dispersibilities and prove their correlation, based on which we design the untargeted backdoor watermark under both poisoned-label and clean-label settings. We also discuss how to use the proposed untargeted backdoor watermark for dataset ownership verification. Experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our methods and their resistance to existing backdoor defenses.},

    abstract = {This paper proposes a text-based data hiding method to insert external information into Microsoft Word document. First, the drawback of low embedding efficiency in the existing text-based data hiding methods is addressed, and a simple attack, DASH, is proposed to reveal the information inserted by the existing text-based data hiding methods. Then, a new data hiding method, UniSpaCh, is proposed to counter DASH. The characteristics of Unicode space characters with respect to embedding efficiency and DASH are analyzed, and the selected Unicode space characters are inserted into inter-sentence, inter-word, end-of-line and inter-paragraph spacings to encode external information while improving embedding efficiency and imperceptivity of the embedded information. UniSpaCh is also reversible where the embedded information can be removed to completely reconstruct the original Microsoft Word document. Experiments were carried out to verify the performance of UniSpaCh as well as comparing it to the existing space-manipulating data hiding methods. Results suggest that UniSpaCh offers higher embedding efficiency while exhibiting higher imperceptivity of white space manipulation when compared to the existing methods considered. In the best case scenario, UniSpaCh produces output document of size almost 9 times smaller than that of the existing method.}
